        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Established in 1998, StockPlus Financial Services has grown from an equity sub-broking firm into a complete wealth management company, integrating all financial products under one roof.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Over the years, we have transitioned from pure broking to an advisory-based financial planning entity, focusing on transparency, stringent risk management, and a client-first approach.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Recognized for our insight and advice, we continue to deliver trusted solutions that help our clients achieve their financial goals.
